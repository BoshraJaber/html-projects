                    <p class= "water1" >Water covers much of the world’s surface. Its ubiquity in many forms, in sea, in rain, in sweat and so on, perhaps explains why it has held such a fascination for mankind. Today, most of our lives are somewhat divorced from nature, in comparison with our forefathers who toiled the land or hunted their prey. Today over half the world’s population inhabits cities. A minority lives in the countryside. However, even in cities, people are willing to pay a premium to have a view of a river or a sea. </p>
